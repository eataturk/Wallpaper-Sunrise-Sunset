Add everything inside a folder named "Wallpaper-Sunrise-Sunset".
Create a folder named 'scripts/' with 'wallpaper.sunset.sh', 'wallpaper.sunrise.sh' and 'wallpaper.times.sh'.
Create a folder named 'plists/' with 'com.wallpaper.sunset.plist', 'com.wallpaper.sunrise.plist' and 'com.wallpaper.times.plist'.
Switch current files' directorys to be more general so it works anywhere.

When Installed:
  Ask where to download the folder.
  Ask for the sunrise wallpaper
  Ask for the sunset wallpaper.
  Ask for latitude and longitude.
